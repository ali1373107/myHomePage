        <h2> About me </h2>
        <p>
          I am 27 seven years old and since I understood life, I was learning and that made me what I am today.<br>I worked more on my language ever than before
        </p>
        <p>
          I was born in Iran and studied in Architecture standing  until my twenties then I had to leave my country and come here to seeking for asylum in England.<br>
          It was hard time at the beginning without family, friend even knowing a single word of English but I did not sit down and wait to see what the world will bring to me. 
        </P>
        <p>
          I stoodup and went to make my dreams come true.
          on that time I was not permitted to work so I started working voluntary and coaching children at boxing gym in Swindon to keep myself busy and take care of my mental health.<br> After long time I got my permission to live in the UK with a lot of good friends and brilliant community around me.
        </p>
        <p id= "pragraph"> After opening new door in my life I decided to continue to studying in UK and I worked harder on my language skill ever than before to get acceptance from university and after hard working finally <br>I got offer from Southampton Solent university 
   But happily in software engineering subject as i had interest of technology and IT science.</p>
